### Create an empty local website

You can create and IIS/Apache/Node...etc application root, or just reuse one that you already have. The code needs to be run within a context of an application so the JavaScript permissions behave.

For this particular session, we'll be working with your command prompt more so than your IDE.

### Clone this entire repo, and copy the files to the root of that application.

Open the root of the application in a code editor such as Sublime Text or Visual Studio.
